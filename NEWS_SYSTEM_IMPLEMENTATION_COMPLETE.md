## 🔧 Backend Implementation

### Database Schema

**News Table** (`news`):
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `title` (String, required)
- `content` (Text, required) - Full article content
- `excerpt` (Text, optional) - Short summary
- `image_url` (String, optional)
- `is_published` (Boolean, default: false)
- `published_at` (Timestamp)
- `author` (String, optional)
- `sort_order` (Integer, default: 0)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (Timestamps)

**Banners Table** (`banners`):
- `id` (UUID, Primary Key)
- `title` (String, required)
- `subtitle` (String, optional)
- `image_url` (String, optional)
- `link` (String, optional) - For standard banners
- `banner_type` (ENUM: 'standard', 'news_linked')
- `news_id` (UUID, Foreign Key → news.id) - For news-linked banners
- `sort_order` (Integer, default: 0)
- `is_active` (Boolean, default: true)
- `created_at`, `updated_at` (Timestamps)

**Relationship**: 
- `News` hasMany `Banners` (one news can have multiple banners)
- `Banner` belongsTo `News` (banner links to one news item)
- Cascade delete: When news is deleted, linked banners are auto-deleted

### API Endpoints

#### Public Endpoints (No Auth Required):
```
GET  /api/news              → List all published news
GET  /api/news/:id          → Get single published news article
GET  /api/banners           → Get all active banners (includes news data)
```

#### Admin Endpoints (Auth + Admin Role Required):
```
GET    /api/news/admin/all                → List all news (published + drafts)
POST   /api/news/admin/create             → Create new news article
PUT    /api/news/admin/:id                → Update news article
DELETE /api/news/admin/:id                → Delete news article
PATCH  /api/news/admin/:id/toggle-publish → Toggle publish status

GET    /api/admin/banners     → List all banners
POST   /api/admin/banners     → Create banner
PUT    /api/admin/banners/:id → Update banner
DELETE /api/admin/banners/:id → Delete banner
```

### Controller Logic

**News Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/newsController.js`):
- Creates/updates news articles
- Automatically creates/updates linked banners when `add_to_banner` flag is true
- Auto-sets `published_at` timestamp when publishing
- Handles banner visibility based on news publish status
- Cascade deletes linked banners when news is deleted

**Banner Controller** (`backend/src/controllers/bannerController.js`):
- Fetches active banners with associated news data
- Includes News model in response for news-linked banners
- Supports both standard (link-based) and news-linked banners
