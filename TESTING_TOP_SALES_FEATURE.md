## Sample Test Data

If you need to populate sales_count for testing:

```sql
-- Update some items with sales counts
UPDATE menu_items 
SET sales_count = 150 
WHERE name LIKE '%Pizza%' 
LIMIT 1;

UPDATE menu_items 
SET sales_count = 120 
WHERE name LIKE '%Burger%' 
LIMIT 1;

UPDATE menu_items 
SET sales_count = 100 
WHERE name LIKE '%Pasta%' 
LIMIT 1;

-- Continue for more items...
```

Or use the backend script if available:
```bash
cd /workspace/backend
npm run seed
```

## Visual Verification Points

### Badge Appearance
- **Colors**: Gradient from amber-400 â†’ orange-500 â†’ red-500
- **Size**: Small but readable (text-xs)
- **Position**: Top-left, 8px from edges (top-2 left-2)
- **Shadow**: Orange glow effect
- **Animation**: Bouncy entrance with rotation

### Image Size Comparison
| Before | After |
|--------|-------|
| h-32 (128px) | h-48 (192px) |
| Static | Hover zoom (scale-105) |

### Layout Changes
| Before | After |

| "Hot Sales" section | "Top Sellers" banner |
| Featured items separate | All items in one grid |
| Fixed "HOT" badge | Dynamic "TOP N" badge |

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue: Badges not showing
**Solution**: Check that items have sales_count > 0 and are properly sorted

### Issue: Animation not working
**Solution**: Clear browser cache, check that style tag is appended

### Issue: Images too large on some screens
**Solution**: Verify aspect-ratio and object-cover are working

### Issue: Top 10 shows wrong items
**Solution**: Verify backend is returning items sorted by sales_count DESC

## Success Criteria

âœ… All menu items display with larger, clearer food images  
âœ… Top 10 items show animated rank badges  
âœ… Items are sorted by sales count (most popular first)  
âœ… UI is intuitive and visually appealing
